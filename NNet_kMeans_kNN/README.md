# k-Means, k-Nearest-Neighbor, and Neural Network
Implementation of k-Means, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Deep Neural Network by Numpy

- k-Means: alternating optimization to search for the optimal partition and centers
- k-Nearest-Neighbor: lazy algorithm that do jobs at predicting
- Neural Network: can specify many layers and different activation function(ex. ReLU, tanh, sigmoid)
